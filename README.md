# LearningElectron
This is me Learning all about Electron and all it has to help me in Desktop Application development
I've always surrounded myself with things relating to IT. I gained personal experience in programming, I gained professional experience in my previous job by working as a Technical Support specialist for Customers who use Lenovo laptops and Desktops. My previous job has largely added to my knowledge of Computer hardwares and how they work. I've also spent time learning about softwares installed on computers and how they work. I'm always thinking of something I can do in the IT industry that can revolutionise my surroundings or my country or even the world. I'm yet to find that out but until then, i'll keep gathering as much knowledge and experience in IT as i can. Either PROFESSIONALLY or PERSONALLY.
